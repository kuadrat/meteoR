\description{
Implements the Angstrom-Prescott formula for estimation of terrestrial
radiation based on extraterrestrial radiation and relative sunshine
duration.
The Rietveld coefficients a and b are taken from
Rietveld, M. R. A New Method for Estimating the Regression Coefficients in
the Formula Relating Solar Radiation to Sunshine. Agricultural Meteorology
1978, 19 (2), 243â€“252. https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-1571(78)90014-6.
